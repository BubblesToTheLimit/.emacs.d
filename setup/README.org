* Why setting up a remote emacs installation is useful
  When doing system administration for a whole day or longer on a new remote machine it is
  convenient to start emacs from that remote machine.
  - I can document my work with org-babel most efficiently, because it has the highest performance
    when interacting with the local host
  - When someone interrupts me in my work which during a whole day is definately going to happen I
    have to switch contexts easily. Having the contexts conveniently divided simply by using the
    two different instances of emacs I dont really need to search for buffers or switch my screen
    configuration (split screens, etc). Simply by switching to my local emacs I already have all
    my general notes open and I can technically context-switch within a second.

  For this I install emacs with my configuration on those remote systems. This task can be
  automated using the compile_emacs.sh script.

* Emacs for windows
  There is a difference in emacs compilations, since each of them includes different binaries,
  enabling different kinds of functions in emacs. On the search for the best emacs compilation
  I've tried a considerable amount (see list below), however, there is a fix for that. It comes in
  the form of an awesome zip-file though which simply has all the emacs dependencies, it can just
  be unzipped in the same directory as the actual emacs compilation. It can be downloaded here
  (64-bit): http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25-x86_64-deps.zip

  Emacs compilations for windows I tried:
  - http://www.russet.org.uk/scratch/
    - Its supposed to be faster than current emacs 25 compilations, I couldnt confirm that though
    - Discussion over here: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-11/msg00280.html
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/
    - I use this one right now
    - The only thing this compilation doesn't do well is image-interaction, but since everything
      else works this is my favorite emacs source. For linux I dont care about the source of the
      installation package because I never had any problems.
  - http://emacs.link/
    - can do html export correctly
    - no image support
  - http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/windows/
    - breaks html export for some font lock reason
    - good image support

* Update on linux
  Used this approach on my laptop. Taken from askubuntu.com
  This uses this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
  #+END_SRC
