* Different types of setup
  When I work on a new system for a whole day or longer it is convenient to start emacs from that
  computer.
  - I can document my work with org-babel most efficiently, because it has the highest performance
    when interacting with the local host
  - When someone interrupts me in my work which during a whole day is definately going to happen I
    have the work conveniently divided into two different instances of emacs, one on the remote
    site im working on, one on my local machine with all my project notes and access to all the
    company-infrastructure.

  For this I install emacs with my configuration on those remote systems. This task can be
  automated using the compile_emacs.sh script.

  For windows I download the latest compilation from sourceforge:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/
  The only thing this compilation doesn't do well is image-interaction, but since everything else
  works this is my favorite emacs source. For linux I dont care about the source of the
  installation package because I never had any problems.
