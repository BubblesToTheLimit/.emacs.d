* About this repository
  Started to maintain my emacs-config here on github when I noticed there were more than a handful
  of things I wanted to configure about emacs, and it was too annoying to set them each time by
  hand when switching the environment.

  üèÜ Things I am proud to have accomplished since my first commit here:
  - I use "use-package" for automatic package installation.
  - My config-files are written in org-mode
  - The different environments I work with emacs in are typed (work / home / laptop /
    uni). Depending on the environment I load different packages. I tell emacs which environment I
    am in by setting the system variable "SYSENV".
  - The overall file-structure is not a mess

  üåµ Things I struggle with:
  - Some packages can't be installed on some of the environments I use because of install-errors
    like "this package doesn't untar cleanly". This behaviour is unexpected and a big
    inconvenience. I am still to come up with a solution for this.
  - My coding-system is set to linux now on every system I use. This means I cannot use the
    standart windows editor anymore to edit my files, which is an inconvenience. Alot of my
    colleagues use that editor... There are alot of pros though.

** The ongoing debate about the right coding-system
   Right now I use the unix coding system everywhere, this might be subject to change though.

   Pros:
   - Its easier to copy stuff into the terminal from for example an org-file without weird
     line-ending interactions
   - Makes org-babel codeblocks work in the first place on linux systems, otherwise they cannot
     execute
   - I edit org-files from linux and on windows, which due to org-babel requiring linux
     line-endings makes deciding for either one of them a necessity. Making such a decision
     globally of course also affects the coding-style of this config which I want to share with
     others.
   - There is no comfortable way to convert line-endings without me noticing it, another reason
     why I have to decide for one of the two

   Cons:
   - Editing my configs or files from the Windows Default Editor doesn't work
   - My colleagues are not able to visit my config files since they dont care and only use the
     dos-coding system
