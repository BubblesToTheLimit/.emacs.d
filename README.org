* About Emacs in general
  This config is obviously is highly customized and no good for a beginner. Even for emacs users
  this config is probably only interesting in specific points they can then copy to their own
  config. However I also found some nice tutorials on emacs in general listed here which I'd like
  to point out:
  - https://www.inkandben.com/org-mode-resources for a nice collection of tutorials
  - http://emacs.sexy/ a well done advertisement-like site on emacs
  - https://emacsthemes.com/

* About this repository
  Started to maintain my emacs-config here on github when I noticed there were more than a handful
  of things I wanted to configure about emacs, and it was too annoying to set them each time by
  hand when switching the environment.

  üèÜ Things I am proud to have accomplished since my first commit here:
  - I use "use-package" for automatic package installation.
  - My config-files are written in org-mode
  - The different environments I work with emacs in are typed (work / home / laptop /
    uni). Depending on the environment I load different packages. I tell emacs which environment I
    am in by setting the system variable "SYSENV".
  - The overall file-structure is not a mess

  üåµ Things I struggle with:
  - Some packages can't be installed on some of the environments I use because of install-errors
    like "this package doesn't untar cleanly". This behaviour is unexpected and a big
    inconvenience. I am still to come up with a solution for this.
  - My coding-system is set to linux now on every system I use. This means I cannot use the
    standart windows editor anymore to edit my files, which is an inconvenience. Alot of my
    colleagues use that editor... There are alot of pros though.

** The ongoing debate about the right coding-system
   Right now I use the unix coding system everywhere, this might be subject to change though.

   Pros:
   - Its easier to copy stuff into the terminal from for example an org-file without weird
     line-ending interactions
   - Makes org-babel codeblocks work in the first place on linux systems, otherwise they cannot
     execute
   - I edit org-files from linux and on windows, which due to org-babel requiring linux
     line-endings makes deciding for either one of them a necessity. Making such a decision
     globally of course also affects the coding-style of this config which I want to share with
     others.
   - There is no comfortable way to convert line-endings without me noticing it, another reason
     why I have to decide for one of the two

   Cons:
   - Editing my configs or files from the Windows Default Editor doesn't work
   - My colleagues are not able to visit my config files since they dont care and only use the
     dos-coding system

** Research enabled by this config
   I'm writing my bachelor-thesis with this config. In order to do that i included quite alot of
   config settings into my emacs config. An alternative to this would be downloading an emacs
   distribution / config that is designed just for writing scientifical papers, like [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][Scimax]].

   Configuration that specifically enables me to do that is tagged with "research". On linux i had
   to install packages ontop of simple configuratino inside emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo apt-get install ess
   sudo apt-get install texlive #required for pdf rendering (and more?)
   sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra #stop the pdf-export from failing due to missing package "wrapfig.sty"
   sudo apt-get install r-base #enables the creation of graphs from emacs
   #+END_SRC

** The structure of these config files
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results list :exports result
   ls *.el
   #+END_SRC

   - ("org-init.el")
     - bootstraps the initialization through org-mode
   - ("init.el")
     - customizes the default emacs behaviour
   - ("my-org-usepackages.el")
     - adds and customizes packages
   - ("elisp-goodies.el")
     - my custom functions and things im working on
   - ("custom-settings.el")
     - i cant seem to stop emacs from creating this file
