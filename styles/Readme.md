The styles section
==================

Hello dear reader,

this section contains css files to help org-export to html.
These files currently have to be copied to whatever directory your org-files are in for most
convenience in my oppinion.

Using windows then add this to the top of your file (notice the double-backslashes):

    #+HTML_HEAD:  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles\\base.css" />
